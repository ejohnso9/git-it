This directory will be made into a git repository that goes with the nodeschool.io
workshopper 'git-it', and the associated web pages at:

    http://jlord.us/git-it/challenges/repository.html

The challenge directs you to create directory 'hello-world'. I created mine as
'hello_git'. Let's see if that causes problems.
